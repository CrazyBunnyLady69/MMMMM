  * Laser
  * 3D Print
  * Documentation
  * Procurement
  * Electrical
  * Events

### Member Submitted Items
* Heating
  * Oil filled radiator isn't cutting it, can be knocked over/plugged in anywhere
  * Circuit issue remains, extension reels aren't a good solution.
  * Why not use infrared lamps??
  * Benefits are vast:
    * Safe - high up out of reach, away from flammable things, can't fall over/be kicked
    * Dedicated circuit - that can't have other stuff plugged in so no melty moments
    * Heats people and things, not air
    * Can be mounted from ceiling or pillars for good coverage
    * Timer switch for instant heat that doesn't stay on all night or risk being left on
    * With them in place we can forbid plugging in of any heaters!
    * Not expensive! https://www.amazon.co.uk/Firefly-FreeStanding-Resistant-Infared-Electric/dp/B00C2T5WVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1507410024&sr=8-1&keywords=outdoor%2Bheat%2Blamp&th=1
* 3D Printer filament proposal
  * Space 3D Printer Filament to be sold by mass of finished parts (propose 4p/g)
  * Failed prints not charged for (absorbed in price of filament)
  * All filament to bear ownership label by $DATE (or something)
  * Limit to personal filament storage (2 reels?)
* Metal area
  * There's been some suggestion that we should close the open gap in the metal area that faces the members storage. So that shelves can be added there. I can cost up the materials but one point of discussion might be if there should be a door fitted in that wall. (Richard)
* Pound coin retirement
  * When will the bank accept old pound coins until?
    * "Until Further Notice"
  * Notices informing that the old coin is not valid for payment? 
  * Last bank run had 2 blatantly obvious fakes
* Need for volunteers for 'A Grand Exposition'
  * Was discussed at the last two MMMMs, with members wanting us to attend
  * The event is this weekend
  * We have too few people to run the event, we need more otherwise we may either have to only attend one day, or pull out entirely.
    * Please message us on the [http://list.hacman.org.uk/t/a-grand-exposition-volunteers-required/2294 list], put yourselves on the [https://doodle.com/poll/qhiwz3n93vky3499 Doodle Poll], or poke me on the telegram group - @badspyro
* HTSD
  * As per the telegram discussion the other day
  * Skip
  * Date
